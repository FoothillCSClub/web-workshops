# Philosophy of the Workshops

1. Encourage Creativity
2. For All Skill Levels
3. Modular Workshops


## 1. Encourage Creativity

Above all, the goal is to create things.  
Computer Programming is fun and creative.
These workshops present tools that help you create things.

The goal is to take an idea you have in your imagination and bring it to life.
These tools can help you achieve that.

In the following analogy, replace *your workshop language/framework/tool* with 
*paint brush*.  Replace *program/project* with *painting*.


Imagine that Your workshop is about a paint brush.
- How do you use the paint brush?
- Help people paint the picture they want to paint.
- Guide people through painting, and encourage them to keep painting.


Imagine that another workshop may introduce pastels.
- Why are you using a paint brush?
- What unique things can the paint brush do?
- How might you combine the paint brush with other tools?



## 2. For All Skill Levels

Main Points

- Assume that you will be teaching people who have never programmed before.
- Prepare for a variety of people.
- Tag intermediate/advanced topics as "optional" or "additional" topics.


Provide Guidance for the Beginners.

- Plan a walk through guide.  Go step-by-step.
- Nobody should feel left behind.
- Give beginners personal and individual attention.



Give space for the Advanced People to go on.

- Write down the advanced topics separately.
- If anybody wants to go faster than the current pace of the workshop, they can go to the advanced section.
- Leave some resources, topics, and exercises for the advanced people to try.
- Write down an "advanced challenge".






## 3. Modular workshops 

> Modular:
>
> employing or involving a module or modules as the basis of design or construction.



The modularity of the workshops somewhat mirrors the [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) modularity of programs.

- Each workshop adds a tool to your toolkit.
- These tools can be combined together to help realize a creation.


Specifically, for our workshops:

- Use the context of "A personal homepage" as the main project.
- Relate things to the web.
- All topics can go toward building up your own web site.
- The workshops guide you through different topics, where each thing adds something new to the project.


Imagine that you have this variety of people:
- One person just arrived, this is their first workshop
- One person is only able to be here for your workshop, this is their only workshop.
- one person has been here for other workshops, and wants to extend their project.
