# Introduction to Javascript


## Goals

-   Understand what makes Javascript different than other languages
-   Learn what the DOM (Document Object Model)
-   Be able to use [codepen](codepen.io) to make a simple webpage
-   Become empowered with the tools to **break** websites


## Guide

In the HTML and CSS workshop, we learned about how to make a simple webpage using `<tags>`.

Copy and paste this basic script into a [codepen](codepen.io):
```
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

To add a script to the pen, we can insert javascript by using the `<script>` tag like this:
```
<script>
function() helloWorld {

}
<script>
```


## Things to learn

-   Numbers
-   Operators
-   Strings
-   Booleans
-   Logical Operators


[Programs](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html)

-   Variables
    - Let
-   Conditionals:
    - If, Then, Else 
    - Switch
-   Flow of Control: 
    - For, 
    - While, Do
-   Console.log()

[Functions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)

-   Functions

[Data](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html)

-   Lists []
-   Objects {}


## Exercises

-   Play around with javascript using the console (PC: `ctrl`+`option`+`I` or Mac: `CMD`+`option`+`I` )
-   Check out some of the codepen entries from the homepage.
-   Start breaking and inspecting your favorite websites.


## Next Steps 

-   Learn about how Javascript works with HTML through
    The [Document Object Model](http://eloquentjavascript.net/14_dom.html)

-   Coming up next: [Events](http://eloquentjavascript.net/15_event.html)


## Advanced

Full List of keywords:

~~~
break case catch class const continue debugger default
delete do else enum export extends false finally for
function if implements import interface in instanceof let
new package private protected public return static super
switch this throw true try typeof var void while with yield
~~~

Things to do:

-   Figure out what all these keywords do.
-   Write a program that uses unfamiliar ones in some way.
-   Figure out how to use [Regular Expressions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/09_regexp.html).
-   Learn about [Modules](http://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html).

Hardcore Mode:

-   [Asynchronous](http://eloquentjavascript.net/11_async.html)
-   Project Idea: [Make your own Programming Language](http://eloquentjavascript.net/12_language.html).


## Links

-   Highly recommend reading [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/),
    which is accessible for beginners, and will **definitely** teach some of
    the supposedly "advanced" programmers a thing or two (or more).

-   Other than that, the MDN Mozilla documentation for Javascript(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is really complete. They have guides for beginners to advanced.
